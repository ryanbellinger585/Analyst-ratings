# Analyst-ratings
personal attempt at a trading algorithm

Well aware that this is a wildly volatile investment strategy, and not going to use it in my own investment until I get good proof of concept.

Scrapes data about changes in financial analyst ratings from Twitter and tries to predict price movements over the next 24 hours. Also interacts with Cloud storage for storing the dataset and Robinhood and Twitter's APIs for data gathering.

Personal project.
